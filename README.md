This is the code for a simple calculator I made that works in the terminal

To get a copy of this code, do the following command:
`$ git clone https://github.com/PRA7H1K/simple-calculator`

# Python Calculators

## Python [Calculator 1](https://github.com/PRA7H1K/simple-calculator/blob/main/Python%20Calculators/calculator_1.py)
This calculator has more lines of code but is less "smart" than calculator 2.

### Example:
```
First Number: <enter a number>
Operator: <enter an operator>
Second Number: <enter second number>
<answer will show here>
```

## Python Calculator 2
This calculator is more "smart" than calculator 1 in the sense that you can type the whole expression in 1 line instead of breaking it down to multiple lines as shown in calculator 1.

### Example:
```
Calculator: <enter expression>
<answer will show here>
```

# C# Calculator
To get the C# calculator, you can either get it with git or you can download the Console App.exe file located in __C# Calculators / Bin / Debug__

## C# Calculator 1
This calculator is very similar to the Python calculator 1.

### Example:
```
First Number: <enter a number>
Operator: <enter an operator>
Second Number: <enter second number>
<answer will show here>
```


All the calculators have error handlers
