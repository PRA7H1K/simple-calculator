This is the code for a simple calculator I made that works in the terminal

To get a copy of this code, do the following command:
`$ git clone https://github.com/PRA7H1K/simple-calculator`

# Calculator 1
This calculator has more lines of code but is less "smart" than calculator 2.

### Example:
```
First Number: <enter a number>
Operator: <enter an operator>
Second Number: <enter second number>
<answer will show here>
```

# Calculator 2
This calculator is more "smart" than calculator 1 in the sense that you can type the whole expression in 1 line instead of breaking it down to multiple lines as shown in calculator 1.

### Example:
```
Calculator: <enter expression>
<answer will show here>
```
Both calculators have error handlers
